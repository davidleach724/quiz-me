# Stretch Project

## Learning Goals

You’ve made it through your first front-end JavaScript framework: React! Now that you have the building blocks down, it’s time to take what you’ve learned, build something creative, and dive into some independent learning of new technologies.

Incorporating a new technology into your application that isn’t explicitly taught will give you the opportunity to differentiate yourself from other Turing grads and give you a great story to tell in your job interview - employers love to hear about your experiences being self driven and learning new technologies outside of the standard Turing curriculum.

No one hires a junior dev based on what the junior already knows. Instead, junior developers are successful when they showcase their ability to learn and ask questions. This project will provide tangible, demonstrable anecdotes for you to bring up during interviews to show your ability to struggle with new material and problem solve!

You have a lot of freedom with this project, but there are a few requirements listed next.

## Requirements

As a group, you need to decide on:

1. A minimum viable product (MVP) idea that solves a problem for your users
2. The use of at least one external API
3. Choose one category from the “Stretch Technologies” section below
4. Meets the specs listed below under MVP.

This application must be deployed by the time it is submitted for evaluation.

## MVP 

The project is very open-ended in that you can make pretty much anything you want. However, we have some requirements to follow:

1. The application cannot simply be a display of data - there needs to be some way for the user to work with or manipulate the data (favoriting, searching, filtering, commenting, rating, etc)
2. The application should be a multi-page application using React Router
3. Be able to answer: What problems are you solving? What features must the solution include to solve this problem?
