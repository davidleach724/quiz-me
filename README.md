### Learning Goals

After working with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the first two modules, Module 3 introduces the magic of React. This project challenged us to implement yet another technology of our choice through self-teaching and exploration. We went with **React's Context API** so we could start working with global state management. Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
